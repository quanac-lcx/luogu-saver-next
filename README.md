## Description

**Luogu Saver Next (LGS-NG)** is a web application designed to help users save and manage user-generated content from [Luogu](https://www.luogu.com.cn/), a popular Chinese competitive programming platform. This tool allows users to archive articles, pastes, and other content types, ensuring that valuable information is preserved and remains easily accessible.

## Features

- **Content Archiving:** Save articles and pastes directly from Luogu.
- **Management UI:** User-friendly interface for organizing saved content.
- **Broad Support:** Handles multiple content types efficiently.
- **High Performance:** Utilizes client-side rendering for a smooth user experience.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for use on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Intelligent Recommendations:** Suggests related content based on user activity.

## Architecture

This project is a **Monorepo** managed by npm workspaces:

- **Root:** Manages shared dev-dependencies (Prettier, TypeScript, etc.) and orchestration.
- **`packages/frontend`:** Vue 3 + Vite application (Naive UI).
- **`packages/backend`:** Koa + TypeScript API service.

## Build Instructions

**Prerequisites:** Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 22.18.0 or higher) installed.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ark-Aak/luogu-saver-next.git
cd luogu-saver-next
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install dependencies for the root and all workspaces in one go:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Build

You can build the entire project (Frontend & Backend) with a single command:

```bash
npm run build
```

Or build them individually using npm workspaces:

**Frontend Only:**

```bash
# Optional: Set environment variables inline
# VITE_API_URL=[https://api.example.com](https://api.example.com) npm run build -w @luogu-saver-next/frontend
npm run build -w @luogu-saver-next/frontend
```

*The compiled static files will be located in `packages/frontend/dist`.*

**Backend Only:**

```bash
npm run build -w @luogu-saver-next/backend
```

*The compiled backend files will be located in `packages/backend/dist`.*

## Deployment

### 1. Run the Backend Server

Navigate to the backend workspace or run directly from the root:

```bash
cd packages/backend
# Install production dependencies only
npm install --production
# Start the server
node dist/index.js
```

The server will start on the configured port (default is `3000`).

### 2. Serve the Frontend

You need a web server (e.g., **Nginx** or **Caddy**) to serve the static files located in:
`packages/frontend/dist`

### 3. Configuration & Proxying

If you did not set the `VITE_API_URL` variable during the frontend build, the application defaults to sending requests to `/api` on the same domain.

**Crucial Step:** You must configure your web server (Nginx/Caddy) to reverse proxy requests starting with `/api` to the running backend service (e.g., `localhost:3000`).

## Development

We use `concurrently` to run both frontend and backend in watch mode with a single command.

### Start Development Server

In the project root, simply run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will:

1. Start the **Frontend** (Vite) in watch mode.
2. Start the **Backend** (ts-node-dev) in watch mode.
3. Output logs from both services in the same terminal (color-coded).
